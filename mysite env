Always copy the path...
Virtualenv location: /home/seanroberts/.local/share/virtualenvs/MY_SITE-Kak_oB8v    
OR
. /home/seanroberts/.local/share/virtualenvs/MY_SITE-Kak_oB8v/bin/activate   

correct procedure:
1. SYNTAX:
$ cd /path/to/your/virtualenv/
$ source bin/activate

2. cd /home/seanroberts/.local/share/virtualenvs/MY_SITE-Kak_oB8v (First)
   source bin/activate (Second)

ALSO CHECK THE INITIAL DIRECTORY AND CHANGE IT TO

....    ~/Desktop/MY_SITE OR /Desktop/MY_SITE

FINAL PROCEDURE.

cd /home/seanroberts/.local/share/virtualenvs/MY_SITE-Kak_oB8v (First)
source bin/activate (Second)
cd ~/Desktop/MY_SITE (Third...this takes you back to the initial directory..)
cd name of your project e.g cd voting_project








for manage.py to work...you will need to change the directory (cd) to the name od your newly
created site.
for example if my site is pollster
i will change it to cd pollster then enter ls which will result into
manage.py  pollster

this occurs after creating 
$ django-admin startproject pollster
